Assignment no: 4 - Numpy_Basics
Prepared By: Sheikh Saqib

This repository contains the solution to the Numpy Basics Assignment, which covers a series of practical tasks designed to understand the fundamental concepts of NumPy and its application in Python. The assignment involves working with various NumPy array types, performing basic mathematical operations, and using advanced functions such as matrix inversion, axis-wise summation, and array reshaping.

Tasks Covered in This Assignment:

Matrix Creation & Extraction:

Creating a matrix based on specific conditions.

Extracting rows and columns from the matrix.

Justifying why extracting a column returns a 1D array.

Two-Sum Problem:

Solving the famous "two-sum" problem using an efficient dictionary-based approach to find two indices whose values sum up to a given target.

1D Array Properties:

Creating a 1D array and printing its properties such as dtype, shape, size, and memory usage.

Reshaping a 1D Array to a 2D Matrix:

Converting a 1D array into a 3x4 matrix.

Accessing elements within the reshaped matrix.

Matrix Operations:

Computing basic statistical measures such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation on a 1D array.

Matrix Inversion:

Inverting a 2x2 matrix and verifying the result by checking that the product of the matrix and its inverse equals the identity matrix.

Working with 3D Arrays:

Creating a 3D array and performing summation along different axes.

Transposing a 3D array to change its shape and dimensions.

Key Concepts & Techniques:

Matrix and Array Operations:

Understanding slicing, reshaping, and indexing.

Operations on multi-dimensional arrays (2D and 3D).

Statistical Functions:

Mean, median, variance, and standard deviation computations.

Matrix Algebra:

Matrix inversion and identity matrix verification.

Efficient Algorithms:

Solving the "Two-Sum" problem with a dictionary for optimal time complexity.
